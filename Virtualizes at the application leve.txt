Virtualizes at the application level, wrapping applications in a virtual layer to isolate them from the OS and other apps.

The virtualization layer sits on top of the host operating system and provides an abstraction for the application.
The application is isolated in its own "sandbox," so it interacts with the host system only through the virtualized layer.

Virtualizes individual apps instead of the whole system. Each app runs in its own bubble (called a "sandbox") so itâ€™s isolated from everything else.
